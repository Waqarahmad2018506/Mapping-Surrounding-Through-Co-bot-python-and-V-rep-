# CS3331-Final-Project

This is a script that was written/modified for my Intro to Robotics final group project.

Python script to interface with V-REP to move a Pioneer P3DX robot to see red objects and navigate to them.

Created and tested on [V-REP PRO EDU](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) (Version 3.6.1)

The obstacle avoidance alogrithm is from [Nikolai K. on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2P7h5Vik9tLafPQ2hlKVLA).

The video the code was pulled from:
